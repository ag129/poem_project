My generative poem display is a display of William Carlos Williams' poem, This Is Just To Say.

I chose to display the first stanza of the poem by revealing one line at a time written in black text. The background color is randomly selected from a list of options when each new line of the stanza is printed. The vertical position of each line is fixed while its horizontal position is randomly generated within a range of positions.

For the second stanza I chose to keep the background a single color and have each line appear one by one. Each line appeared in white with a randomly generated color (from a list of possible colors) highlighting the text. This visually looked like each line had a colored rectangle behind it (it was possible for that rectangle to end up the same color as the screen background). Both the vertical and horizontal position of each line were randomly generated within a range of positions for each line, allowing for the possibility of the lines overlapping one another.

The third stanza is a reverse of the first stanza styling, with a black background and randomly colored lines of text. The lines appear one by one in fixed vertical and random horizontal positions. 

I displayed this piece within the context of the class piece by encasing the ESP32 and its battery in a box made of thick paper with a hole punch in it to loop a string through, and attaching the other end of the string to a popicle stick with a hole for the string in it. To keep the battery and screen in place you should use double sided tape to stick it into the paper box prior to folding up the box.
I decorated my paper container with snow, to go with the "icebox" and "cold" of the poem as well as plums. I also included the poem title and some abstract design.
Before installing this piece, you need to upload the code onto the ESP32 TTGO T-Display, solder a connection between the battery wires and the ESP32 TTGO T-Display, and make sure the battery is fully charged. 
My classmates displayed their pieces in a similar fashion to me, creating our group display piece. We all used white containers and black ink to create a sense of connection between the pieces.
